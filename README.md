# emoklore-sheet
Custom character sheet of Emo-klore for Roll20.

This is made mostly by cloning functionality from [emoklore.charasheet.jp](emoklore.charasheet.jp) 
and by specification from the rule book which can be found [here](https://emoklore.dicetous.com/).

By nature of roll20 character sheets, libraries used are pasted instead of pulled in as dependency. 
For repeating setions handling I used [TAS (theAaronSheet)](https://github.com/shdwjk/TheAaronSheet).

# Roadmap (Todos)
- Custom Roll parsing for luck and judgements.
- Show/hide level zero skils.
- Translations are pending, currently its bilingual in the form of EN/JP.
